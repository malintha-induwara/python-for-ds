Python Tuples

The difference betweeen List and Tuple is that 

List are mutable
Tuples are immutable

We use tuples for storing constant values
like geo cordinates 
Eg: (39.1,32.41)


Duplicate values are also acceptable

    Operands
    |   | 
Z = X + Z
  ^   ^
  |   |
  Operators


Operators in Python are special symbols that perform operations on variable and values
