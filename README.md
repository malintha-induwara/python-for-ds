# Python for Data Science Learning Repository

This repository contains my personal notes, exercises, and examples as I learn Python for Data Science.

## Repository Structure

### Notes

The `Notes` directory contains chronological entries organized by date, covering key concepts and insights:

- **Basics of Python** - Variables, data types, and operators
- **Data Collections** - Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
- **Functions** - Parameters, arguments, lambda functions
- **Data Handling** - CSV files, structured data
- **NumPy** - Multi-dimensional arrays and matrix operations
- **Web Scraping** - Extracting data from websites

### Exercises

The `Exercises` directory contains practical examples covering various Python concepts:

1. **Basic Python** - Variables, conditionals, loops
2. **Data Structures** - Lists, tuples, and operations
3. **Functions & Lambda** - Function definitions, arguments, lambda expressions
4. **Object-Oriented Programming** - Classes, inheritance, encapsulation
5. **File Operations** - Reading and writing files
6. **Advanced Topics** - Recursion, decorators
7. **Data Science Libraries** - NumPy, Pandas examples

#### Special Exercise Directories

- **Extra** - Contains advanced algorithm implementations like binary search and fibonacci

### Environment Setup

- The `Env` directory contains environment variables and configuration
- `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control

## Key Concepts Covered

- Python fundamentals and best practices
- Data structures and their applications
- Functional and Object-Oriented Programming
- Data manipulation and analysis
- Algorithm implementation
- File handling and data persistence

## Getting Started

To run these examples:

1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.6+)
3. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas python-dotenv
   ```
4. Navigate to specific exercise directories to run examples
